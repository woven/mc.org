This is a listing of known bugs, features that mostly work but are still
somewhat in progress, features that are being considered or planned for
implementation, and just miscellaneous far-out ideas that could, in
principle, be implemented if one had the time and inclination to do so.

(NOTE: there is no guarantee any of these items will, in fact, be
implemented, nor should any possible scheduling indications be construed as
promises under any circumstances. TANSTAAFL. If you absolutely need
something implemented right now, please contact the developers to see if
they're available for contract work, or whether a modest donation could
perhaps speed things along.)

TODO: MISSING FEATURES
----------------------
* Tracing of watchdog messages has not yet been implemented.

TODO: NEAR-TERM TASKS
---------------------
* Filter by user role and/or by IP address?
* Add an option to overwrite the output file, instead of appending to it.
* Add two new output drivers: socket and email.
* Add an option to ignore repeated, duplicate errors.
* Test and ensure compatibility with the Devel module (especially with
  regards to the shared `dev_query' variable).
* Drupal core patch to improve tracing capabilities in the database layer.
* Write the developer documentation (API.txt).

TODO: UNDER CONSIDERATION
-------------------------
* Add host name to the REQUEST trace message (useful for multi-sites).
* Add option to include the contents of the page response into the trace
  output, or to write each response into a separate file in a directory?
* Look into adding XDebug support?
* Allow multiple output drivers to be active simultaneously, with possibly
  different settings. Useful for having critical production error messages
  go into the syslog or be e-mailed, while still having the possibility to
  send more verbose debugging output to a file from time to time.
* Add setting to add trace output as a comment to the end of the HTML page?
* More accurate time adjustments to account for time lost to tracing?

TODO: LONG-TERM IDEAS
---------------------
* Implement ability to dynamically and on-the-fly inject tracing statements
  into any third-party module with some fancy tokenizing hacks. (Requires
  early calls to drupal_get_filename() to override module filenames before
  they are loaded by Drupal.)
* Look into PHP's register_tick_function() for potential advanced uses.
