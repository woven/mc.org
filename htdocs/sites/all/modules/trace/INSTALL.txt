REQUIREMENTS
------------
This version of Trace is designed for Drupal 6.x. It should work on both
Unix platforms and Windows, but the latter has not been tested.

INSTALLATION
------------

  1. Copy all the module files into a subdirectory called
     sites/all/modules/trace/ under your Drupal installation directory.

  2. Go to [Administer >> Site building >> Modules] and enable the Trace
     module. (Don't worry, tracing is NOT yet activated simply by enabling
     the module.)

  3. Go to [Administer >> Site configuration >> Tracing] to review and
     change the configuration options to your liking.

     At the very least, select whether you want tracing output to go to a
     log file or to the system log.

     IMPORTANT: to prevent any potential WSOD (white screen of death) from
     disabling access to your site, the page filter settings have been
     preset to always disable tracing on the login page (user/login) and any
     of the administration pages (admin*). This means you will always be
     able to access this settings page (admin/settings/trace) to disable
     tracing, if needed.

  4. Tracing is now ready for use. From the same screen, activate tracing
     when necessary, e.g. when debugging a problem, and deactivate it
     afterwards.

     IMPORTANT: unless you know what you're doing (i.e. have configured a
     minimal set of enabled tracing options), do NOT leave tracing active
     unattended on a busy production server, as the log file will grow
     extremely large very quickly and could bring your entire server down.

  5. (See README.txt for information on submitting bug reports.)
