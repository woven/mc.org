INSTALLATION 
-------------

For the basic install you only need to enable the module and mc_cron and Elysia 
Cron will be up and running.

You can stop here if you don't need a great precision over task execution and
you don't have to execute a task more often than once an hour.  
For example, if you need only the "Once a day", "Once a week" or "Once a month" 
schedule rules the basic install is fine.

Instead, if you need:
- to run some tasks more often than once an hour (eg: you have a function that
  should be executed every 5 minutes)
- to execute a task at an exact time (eg:you must run a function at exactly 
  "17:23") 
... you must follow Step B


STEP B: CHANGE SYSTEM CRONTAB (OPTIONAL)
-----------------------------------------

To get the full potential out of elysia cron and have the full control over you
tasks a further step is needed: you need to configure the system crontab to
execute drupal cron every minute.

To do this refer to the section "Configuring cron jobs" of drupal documentation:
http://drupal.org/cron

While you're editing the system crontab, it's also recommended to replace the
"/cron.php" part with "/sites/all/modules/elysia_cron/cron.php" (default installation 
path of Elysia Cron). This is an optional step (you can leave "/cron.php" if you want), 
doing it will result in a better performance in bigger sites (elysia_cron's cron.php 
handles cache in a better way).

For example: 
* * * * * wget -O - -q -t 1 http://www.example.com/sites/all/modules/elysia_cron/cron.php

IF YOU WANT TO ENABLE CRON KEY SECURITY...

... you should also add the choosen cron key (from elysia_cron setup) to the
call.

Example: 
* * * * * wget -O - -q -t 1 http://www.example.com/sites/all/modules/elysia_cron/cron.php?cron_key=12345678

That's all, now you can go the the cron administration page to configure your
tasks.
