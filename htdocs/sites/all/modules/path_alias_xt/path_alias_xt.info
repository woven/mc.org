name = Extended Path Aliases
description = Automatically extend path aliases to include tabs, like "about-us/edit" for "node/123/edit". Allow these aliases to be entered in page specification wild-cards ("about-us*"), e.g for block visibility.
core = "6.x"
; While you will need to enable the core Path module to enter aliases,
; programmatically path_alias_xt has no dependency on it. Existing aliases
; will continue to be auto-extended, even if Path is disabled later on.
