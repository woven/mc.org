This module shows any image that would have been displayed by imagecache as a 
dummy image. If you are working on localhost or a dev server and all the images
are on the production server - this is the module for you.

To install, enable the module and go to admin/build/imagecache/dummyimage and
configure in which cases you want dummy images to be used. You can also adjust
dummy image appearances there.

The module (quite hostilely) takes over the theming function for imagecache 
and can not be overridden from there. 

This module gives you the choice between these 4 placeholder image services:

The awesome dummy image generator service made by:
Russell Heimlich (@kingkool68)
http://dummyimage.com/

The fabulous placekitten.com service that will make your site full of cute
Kittehs.

The great http://lorempixum.com - gives you random images from categories you
choose.

The cool http://flickholdr.com that lets you choose tags from flickr and have
random images pulled in from there. The tag defaults to tapir of course.
