 Info
------

This module assigns a default image, if no image is provided, for any kind of node. 

The default is assigned depending on the taxonomy term that's associated with.


 Technical Details
-------------------

If no image is provided, the module will look for a image inside path_to_module/images folder, which should have the same name as the taxonomy term, and png as its extension. 

If the module can't find a image with the same name as the taxonomy, then it will assign 'generic.png' as the default image
