 Info
------

This module extends the functionality provided by the Femail module and it also integrates OG with Forums/Discussions. 

It lets the user subscribe to a group's discussions with the following options:
 - All discussions inside a group
 - Discussions I started/Commented on
 - No Discussions at all

The module also improves the user interface to display a more elegant list of Groups/Forums.


 Technical Details
-------------------

The module needs the Femail module and all of its dependencies (like the mailparse php extension) in order to work properly.

The module also has a file called mc_femail_ext_procmail_drush, which should be called through procmail when a new incoming message arrives. This file should also be updated to point to the appropiate drupal installation path.

The flow of how the whole process works is something like this:
 - Mail Transfer Agent MTA (i.e. postfix) gets a incoming email
 - Postfix passes the incoming mail to procmail, which is a Media Delivery Agent (MDA).
 - Procmail should be configured (i.e. by the .procmailrc file in the home folder of a user) to call the mc_femail_ext_procmail_drush file, which is actually a script.
 - mc_femail_ext_procmail_drush script performs a series of functions and calls that include a drush call, in which it parses the contentes of the incoming mail
 - Drush, by using the mailparse php extension, parses the contents of the incoming mail to drupal.
 - Drupal performs all the validations and creates a node of the type forum in the DB.
