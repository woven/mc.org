 Info
------

This module extends the functionality provided by the Femail module and it also integrates OG with Forums/Discussions. 

It lets the user subscribe to a group's discussions with the following options:
 - All discussions inside a group
 - Discussions I started/Commented on
 - No Discussions at all

The module also improves the user interface to display a more elegant list of Groups/Forums.

 Installation
--------------

The module has a file called mc_femail_ext.sh, which should be copied and renamed to local.mc_femail_ext.sh. The newly created file (local.mc_femail_ext.sh) should be updated to point to the appropiate drupal installation path. 

local.mc_femail_ext.sh needs to be called through procmail when a new incoming message arrives. Finally, local.mc_femail_ext.sh won't be included in the GitHub repo.


 Technical Details
-------------------

The module needs the Femail module and all of its dependencies (like the mailparse php extension) in order to work properly.

The flow of how the whole process works is something like this:
 - Mail Transfer Agent MTA (i.e. postfix) gets a incoming email
 - Postfix passes the incoming mail to procmail, which is a Media Delivery Agent (MDA).
 - Procmail should be configured (i.e. by the .procmailrc file in the home folder of a user) to call the mc_femail_ext.sh file, which is actually a script.
 - mc_femail_ext.sh script performs a series of functions and calls that include a drush call, in which it parses the contentes of the incoming mail
 - Drush, by using the mailparse php extension, parses the contents of the incoming mail to drupal.
 - Drupal performs all the validations and creates a node of the type forum in the DB.
