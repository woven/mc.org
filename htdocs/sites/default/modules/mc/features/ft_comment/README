This module holds the comments functionality for any kind of node.


 Technical Details
-------------------

This module dependecies are: ft_comment_ui, og and imagecache_profiles.

Some logic is inside template.php in a preprocess function called "mc_base_preprocess_comment_wrapper".

Basic Functionality:

1) Anonymous users should see a text which invites them to login or register instead of the comments form.

2) Authenticated users must see the normal comment form (Nodes outside a group):

3) Authenticated users not following a group should see a text which invites them to follow the group(Nodes inside a group): 

4) If the Content Type has disabled the comments, the comment form must not appear.
